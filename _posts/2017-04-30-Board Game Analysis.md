### Board Game Analysis with Pandas

I've been taking some Python classes through Data Camp. They're designed around teaching Python with data analysis applications, which is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to apply some of the techniques I had learned on a data set that  was interesting to me, so I started browsing on Kaggle. I found [this](https://www.kaggle.com/mrpantherson/board-game-data), which is aggregated data from Board Game Geek. 

I'll do my best to explain what is going on, mostly to reinforce the lessons with myself. This is a raw notebook file, so some of the graphs do not explain the data well, some are ugly, and some are missing axis labels. 

Importing some packages:


```python
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline # Display graphs inline
sns.set() # Default to Seaborn's graphical style
```

Load in the data:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('bgg_db_2017_03.csv', encoding='latin1')
```

Look at the first 3 rows in the data. I truncated lots of the columns so the table was more visible online.

```python
df.head(3)
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>rank</th>
      <th>bgg_url</th>
      <th>game_id</th>
      <th>names</th>
      <th>min_players</th>
      <th>max_players</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pan...</td>
      <td>161936</td>
      <td>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182028/thr...</td>

Plotting a histogram on the number of votes with 20 bins. This is awful looking, and is missing axis labels.

```python
plt.hist(df['num_votes'], bins=20)
```

Creating a new data frame with trimmed values, that contains the games with the 3 most ratings. This is also terrible way to display this data, but I wanted to try a swarm plot. 

```python
df2 = df[df['num_votes'] > 1000] # trim small values
df2 = df2.nlargest(3,'avg_rating')
sns.swarmplot(y='num_votes',x='names',data=df2)
```

Creating a new data frame that contains the name and the number of votes, sorted by number of votes descending.


```python
df3 = df2[['names','num_votes']].sort_values(by='num_votes',ascending=False)
df3 = df3.set_index('names')
df3
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>num_votes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>names</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Catan</th>
      <td>66826</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Carcassonne</th>
      <td>66218</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Pandemic</th>
      <td>61298</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

Creating a horizontal bar plot of the 20 most rated games using Seaborn's default color scheme. This was mainly to get practice plotting graphs with Seaborn

```python
df2 = df2.nlargest(20,'num_votes')
ax = sns.barplot(x='num_votes',y='names',data=df2)
sns.plt.title('Most Rated Games')
ax.set(xlabel='Number of Votes')
ax.set(ylabel='Game')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

Creating another horizontal barplot, this time with the standard matplotlib plotting methods.

```python
df3['num_votes'][:20].plot(kind='barh')
plt.xlabel('Number of Ratings')
plt.ylabel('Game')
plt.title("Most Rated Games")
```

Slicing the data set into a new data frame that contains only the columns I care about, and sorting it descending by average rating. Again, truncated for brevity. 


```python
best_rated = df2[['names','avg_rating','num_votes','weight']].sort_values(by='avg_rating',ascending=False)
best_rated = best_rated.set_index('names')
best_rated
```

df['avg_max_players'] = df['max_players'].mean()
df['avg_max_players'].value_counts()
